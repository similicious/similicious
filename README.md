### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Simon and I'm a professional software engineer based in Berlin, Germany. `similicious` is what I go by online. I like building useful software and sharing my knowledge.

Despite being specialized in frontend web development, I have a broad interest in all things computers. 

ðŸŽµ Apart from technology, I'm passionate about music, playing the drums, guitar and bass. ðŸ¤˜
